# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### Summary Note for Interview on Context API in React

#### Context API Overview
- **What is the Context API?**
  The Context API is a feature in React that allows data to be passed through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It is particularly useful for managing global state.

- **Why is the Context API considered challenging?**
  The challenge lies in understanding best practices for its use, ensuring efficient re-rendering of components when context values change, and avoiding unnecessary complexity in the application.

#### State Management with Context API
- **How does the Context API help with state management?**
  It provides a centralized way to manage state that can be accessed by any component in the tree, reducing the need for "prop drilling" and simplifying code management.

- **What are the benefits of using Context API for state management?**
  It organizes the data flow between components, simplifies state management, and makes the codebase more manageable and easier to debug.

#### Implementing UI Components
- **How do you implement a UI with input fields and a button using Context API?**
  By creating a user interface with input elements and a button, you can use the Context API to manage the state of these inputs. This involves handling user input, updating the state via context, and demonstrating practical usage of the Context API in a UI.

#### Practical Implementation of Context API
- **What are the steps to implement the Context API in a React application?**
  The process involves creating a context, providing context values, and consuming those values in different components. This centralizes state management and emphasizes its importance in a React application.

#### Theming with Context API
- **How do you set up context for theming in React?**
  By creating a context specifically for managing themes, such as light or dark mode, you provide theme values and allow components to access and apply these themes for consistent styling across the application.

- **How is theme mode functionality implemented using the Context API?**
  This involves setting up the context, providing a way to toggle between themes, and updating the UI based on the current theme context value.

- **Can you give an example of implementing dark mode using the Context API?**
  The implementation demonstrates using the context to manage the theme state, updating components to reflect the current theme, and allowing users to switch between light and dark modes. This practical example shows how the Context API handles complex state changes and UI updates.

By understanding these key points, you can discuss the Context API effectively during an interview, highlighting both theoretical knowledge and practical implementation skills.
